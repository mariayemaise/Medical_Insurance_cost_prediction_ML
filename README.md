# Medical_Insurance_cost_prediction_ML
## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict medical insurance costs based on various factors such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region. The primary goal is to provide accurate cost predictions to aid stakeholders in understanding the financial implications of individual health profiles.

## Key Features
Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numeric features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying patterns and correlations within the dataset.
Model development: Training and evaluating multiple machine learning models to select the best performer.
Performance metrics: Using RÂ² to measure model accuracy.
